# cheat-engine-touch
Cheat Engine Touch is a UI rework by MK2k in order to use Cheat Engine on smaller Windows devices such as the GPD Win.

Cheat Engine Touch is based on Cheat Engine 6.7. Due to the nature of Freepascal code, this fork isn't upstream compatible and will stay at the 6.7 mainline functionality for the time being.
